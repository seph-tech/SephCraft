Small quality-of-life addon for Ascension (WotLK client).

This uses Auctionator pricing data and shows the total material cost of the currently selected recipe directly inside the profession window.

Works with every profession and with extended professions UI addon.

Tooltip features:

Hover over the [AH mats price] line, and it shows full reagent breakdown with total cost. Calculates “After bags” cost (subtracts mats already in your inventory). Shows savings automatically if you have materials.

Hold Shift while hovering:

Switches to a clean shopping list. Shows only materials you still need to buy. Calculates total cost to purchase missing mats.

Auctinator is obviously needed for this addon to work, and is included in rar file. It probably works with other Auctinator versions and on other wotlk servers.
