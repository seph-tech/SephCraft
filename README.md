# SephCraft

This is a quality-of-life addon built for Ascension (3.3.5 WotLK client).

This addon uses Auctionator pricing data and shows the total material cost of the currently selected recipe directly inside the profession window. Auctinator needs for item pricing to be scanned, otherwise it would show "unkown".

Auctinator is obviously needed for this addon to work, and is included. It probably works with other Auctinator versions and on other wotlk servers.
It works with every profession and with extended professions UI addon.


# Features
